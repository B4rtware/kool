#Kotlin + OpenGL = KOOL

A simple OpenGL based graphics engine, which works with Desktop Java as well as
in browsers with Javascript/WebGL (and on Android once I add the platform
bindings)

For now this is nothing more than a simple experiment... However, if you are curious
you can clone this repo and open index.html in the ./out directory in your favourite
browser.
